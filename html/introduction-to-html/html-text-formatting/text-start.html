    Quick humus recipe

    This recipe makes, tasty with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.

    Humus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very testy with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.

    Ingredients

    1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbazo beans)
    175g of tahini
    6 sundried tomatoes
    Half a red pepper
    A pinch of cayenne pepper
    1 Clove of gralic
    A dash of olive olive

    Instructions

    Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely
    Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely
    Add all the ingredients into a food processor
    Process all the ingredients into a paste
    If you want a coarse "chunky" humus, process it fo a short time
    If you want a smooth humus, process it for a longer time

    For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and criander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheesee. Experiment and see what works for you.

    Storage

    Refrigerate the finished humus in a container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If  it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.

    Humus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
